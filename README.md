# Spinnaker Kubernetes V1 to V2 Provider Migration Example

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to provide example deployment pipeline JSON
and resource YAML for a simple deployment workflow using the V1 and V2
providers. There are comments in each manifest describing which resource names,
labels, and annotations are automatically generated by Spinnaker, and which
are safe to remove from resources when migrating to V2.
